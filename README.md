## Input

Script reads data from path specified as command line argument. Any text file will be accepted, but only specific JSON format will be interpreted correctly. Correct input data is a list of edge with specified weight. Additionaly, last element of the list must contain begin and end of route:

```json
[
    ["start_of_edge_1", "end_of_edge_1", "weight_1"],
    ["start_of_edge_2", "end_of_edge_2", "weight_2"],
    ["start_of_edge_...", "end_of_edge_...", "weight_..."],
    ["start_of_edge_n-1", "end_of_edge_n-1", "weight_n-1"],
    ["start_of_edge_n", "end_of_edge_n", "weight_n"],
    ["start", "destination"]
]
```

All values should be numbers. Example input file can be found in [this JSON file](examples/algo.json).

## Output

Script prints only necessary information - it's just one line.

## Usage

```
PS D:\BellmanFord> python .\main.py .\examples\algo.json
Total minimal cost of route from 0 to 3 equals to 4
```
